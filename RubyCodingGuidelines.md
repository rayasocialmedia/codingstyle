# Ruby Coding Guidelines
This Ruby style guide recommends best practices so that we can write code that can be maintained by other Ruby programmers. A style guide that reflects real-world usage gets used, and a
style guide that holds to an ideal that has been rejected by the people it is
supposed to help risks not getting used at all &ndash; no matter how good it is.

The guide is separated into several sections of related rules. We've tried to add the rationale behind the rules (if it's omitted I've
assumed that is pretty obvious).

This guide dose not came up with all the rules out of nowhere - they are mostly based on our extensive career as
a professional software engineers at Raya Social Media, And Much of this was taken from [Ruby Style Guide](https://github.com/bbatsov/ruby-style-guide).

The guide is still a work in progress - some rules are lacking
examples, some rules don't have examples that illustrate them clearly
enough. In due time these issues will be addressed.

[RuboCop](https://github.com/bbatsov/rubocop) is a code analyzer,
based on this style guide.
