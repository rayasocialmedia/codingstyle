Coding Style
===========

This is a guide we use for our coding standard internally at Raya Social Media.

Inspired from https://github.com/bbatsov/ruby-style-guide, Please add to this guide if you find any particular
patterns or styles that we've adopted internally. Submit a pull request to ask for feedback (if you're an employee).
